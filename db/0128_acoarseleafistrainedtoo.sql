-- 0128_acoarseleafistrainedtoo.sql — a tile with nothing under it is built,
-- not merged out of nothing.
--
-- db/0045_coarseleaf.sql: land drawn at a coarse detail has no tiles below its
-- detail, so its finest tile is the bottom of its own ladder. Merging it from
-- sixteen children that do not exist means it is never handed out
-- (db/0035_mergeready.sql), never rendered, and nothing says so. That branch
-- was lost when the sampler was removed and z14 became the floor in code; a
-- leaf below z14 has been getting a merge ever since, and db/0045's own test
-- has been failing.
--
-- db/0126's build_dag with the leaf branch back. There is no sampler any more,
-- so a leaf is built the way z14 is: assembled, framed from the stations of
-- z16-v2, trained at its own budget. Its zoom has no camera set of its own —
-- camera_views is 0 below z14 — so it borrows z14's, which is what the
-- stations are: a grid across whatever the tile covers.
