# PROGRESS.md — where splatworld stands

Task list: `TASKS.md`. Rules: `CLAUDE.md`. Design: `ARCHITECTURE.md`.
Picking up the work: `HANDOFF.md`.

**WP0 is closed.** `make gate` is green end to end (~2m30s, most of it the
concurrency test). WP1 is under way; see the table below for where.

clean.

### Deviations from TASKS.md, and why

1. **WP0.8 was done before WP0.7.** The torture test hammers `publish_tile`
   with stale versions, so that function had to exist first.
2. **`ensure_job` gained a defaulted 4th argument**, `bounty numeric DEFAULT 0`.
   The ARCHITECTURE §4 signature `ensure_job(z,x,y)` still resolves. Without it
   there is no way to satisfy "caller must own an area … **or attach a
   bounty**", because `set_bounty` needs a job that does not exist yet.
3. **`register()` also creates the user's account row.** `account.owner_id` has
   no other source, and every money path assumes one wallet per user. TASKS.md
   parks this in WP4.4; only the wallet UI is left there.
4. **Ledger and account reads are private** (own wallet only). The deliverable
   constrains writes; reads were unspecified and money is not public.
5. **Two migrations were split for the 400-line limit**: `0005_jobs.sql` +
   `0005_state.sql`, and `0008_files.sql` + `0008_admin.sql`. Both pairs sort
   in dependency order. `0009_spot.sql` (WP3.3) is still free.
6. **`gis/splatworld.qgz` is not committed.** See below.

### Open items from WP0

- [ ] `gis/splatworld.qgz` — QGIS writes this itself; the connection file,
      layers and styles it needs are in the repo. Steps in `gis/README.md`.
- [ ] The WP0.11 manual checklist in `gis/README.md` (QGIS → GeoServer →
      Postgres → PostgREST round trip). Needs a running GeoServer and QGIS.
- [ ] `infra/compose.yml` has never been started — no Docker daemon was
      available. The four services were run individually instead
      (`docs/gates.md`).
- [x] `make lint` runs eslint too, as of WP1.1.

## WP1 — Client core: viewer + streaming

| task | status | commit | file(s) |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1.1 Client scaffold | done | see git log | `client/play.html`, `client/js/{api,auth}.js`, `client/lib/tilemath.js`, `client/test/tilemath.test.js`, `client/test/fixtures/tilemath.json`, `tools/tilemath-fixtures.mjs`, `eslint.config.js`, `package.json` |
| 1.2 Test tiles | done | see git log | `tools/{make-test-tiles.mjs,sogwrite.mjs,test-tiles.sh}`, `db/0009_atomid.sql`, `db/test/0009_atomid.sql` |

The published test tiles are z10 (535,361), (535,362), (536,361), (536,362),
their z8 parents (133,90) and (134,90), and z6 (33,22) — near Aarau,
Switzerland. `bash tools/test-tiles.sh` rebuilds them; `make client-test` runs
it whenever a database is reachable.

| task | notes for whoever picks it up |
|---|---|
| 1.3 Tile streaming | `tile.manifest` carries `origin {lon,lat,h}`; nothing about a tile lives in a file. |
| 1.4 Player controller + collision | needs `height.r16` and `colliders.json`, which `assemble` produces in WP2.3 — use hand-made ones. |
| 1.5 Hot swap | poll `GET /api/tile?...&select=published_version,sog_sha256`. |

### Deviations from TASKS.md, and why

7. **eslint is the repo's first npm dependency** (`package.json`,
   `package-lock.json`, dev only). `CLAUDE.md` bans npm packages *in the
   client* and the client still has none — it is plain ES modules served as
   static files. The Makefile written in WP0.1 already looked for
   `node_modules/eslint`; this is what makes that branch fire. `eslint.config.js`
   itself imports nothing.
8. **`make client-test` was fixed, not just extended.** It ran
   `node --test client/test/`, which node 22 resolves as a module path and not
   as a directory of tests. It now uses the same `client/test/*.test.js` glob
   the guard in front of it already used.
9. **`tile_bbox` north/south are compared within 1e-12°, not bit for bit.**
   glibc and V8 disagree by one ulp on `atan(sinh(x))` — about 1e-14°, under a
   nanometre. West and east are pure arithmetic and *are* compared exactly, as
   are `tile_x`, `tile_y` and all 50 `tiles_for_geom` cases; the acceptance
   criterion is met where it can be. Noted in `client/test/tilemath.test.js`.
10. **WP1.2 had to fix a WP0.6 bug first: `db/0009_atomid.sql`.** `build_dag`
    hashed a merge atom over `{children, snapshot}` and `{voxel, budget}`, none
    of which names the tile. Sibling tiles that see the same features and have
    no published children — every tile of a fresh region — collided on
    `atom_hash`, so the second job was handed the first job's atom and ended up
    with no atoms of its own, unable to publish. The merge atom's params now
    carry `z, x, y`, as the assemble branch always did. `db/test/0009_atomid.sql`
    covers it. This would have blocked WP2.8's 16 z12 children too.
11. **"Uploads via PUT as `admin`" is not a bypass.** `can_write` has no admin
    case, so the tool does the real thing: it claims the tile's `sog` atom and
    uploads to the path that claim reserves. It also produces the merge atom's
    ply and uploads it to `/jobs/{atom}/`, so `atom.output_sha256` points at an
    artifact that actually exists.
12. **The tool needs `cwebp`/`dwebp` (Ubuntu `webp`) on the dev box.** A `.sog`
    is a zip of lossless WebP planes and node has no WebP codec; the in-browser
    encoder is WP2.6's `lib/sogenc.js`. `tools/` is dev-box tooling, so shelling
    out to libwebp is in keeping with `seed-ortho.sh` and friends.
13. **Three files, not one.** `tools/sogwrite.mjs` (the SOG v1 writer and its
    decoder) and `tools/test-tiles.sh` (starts postgrest and nginx if nothing is
    serving, and roots the store at `$FILES_ROOT` so the tiles survive for
    WP1.3) sit next to `tools/make-test-tiles.mjs`, which the 400-line rule
    would not have held on its own.
14. **eslint's function-length rule was set to CLAUDE.md's 60 lines** (it was an
    invented statement count before), which split `mountAuth` in `auth.js`.
15. **`make client-test` now builds the test tiles** when a database is
    reachable, and says so when there is none. WP1.3's playwright tests need
    them served, so the gate has to produce them.

## WP2–WP5 ⬜

Not started. WP2.8 lists three open decisions in `TASKS.md` that should be
confirmed with the project owner before WP2.8, not silently assumed.
